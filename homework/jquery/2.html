            This is content of Angelina Wang from Shanghai, China. I��m eighteen years old and now studying in SMU, Dallas. Though I��m still in freshman year, I��ve already planned to major in ComputerScience and minor in Advertising in undergraduate school and major in game design in graduate school.
I really love art stuffs like painting, drawing and sculpture and I have held several exhibitions. I wish I could get better in the future.
